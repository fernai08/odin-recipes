    <h2>Hot to make lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and
      <br />
      layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. <br />
      Here's the run-down:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell
        peppers, onions, and <br />
        a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. <br />
        The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses
          ready.</strong
        >
        <br />
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix
        <br />
        of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor! <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat
        sauce, a layer of <br />
        noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you
        <br />
        have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
